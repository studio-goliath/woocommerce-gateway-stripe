## Stripe with Subscriptions

### Active Subscriptions plugin

### Create a subscriptions product

### View the product

### Click Add to cart

### Go to the checkout page

### Click on **Place order** button

It redirects me to Order received page. I can see the order number and Stripe
as the payment method.

### Go to the admin dashboard and click WooCommerce

I see the order number I created from checkout.

### Click the order number

I see the order status is processing/completed and from Order notes there's **Stripe charge
complete (Charge ID: xxx)**. I understand I may not see the order status changed to processing/completed right away as some payment methods are asynchronous and can take a little time to trigger. But eventually I see the change.

### Go to the subscription that was just created WooCommerce > Subscriptions

### Click into the subscription

### In the action meta box, select ***Process Renewal***

### Click the button to the right of the select box

I see in the subscription notes meta box that a new order was created

### Go back to the order screen and click into the new order that was just created

I see the order status is processing/completed and from Order notes there's **Stripe charge
complete (Charge ID: xxx)**. I understand I may not see the order status changed to processing/completed right away as some payment methods are asynchronous and can take a little time to trigger. But eventually I see the change.
